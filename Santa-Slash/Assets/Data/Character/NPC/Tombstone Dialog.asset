  - message: To find the tombs of the heroes, one must traverse the same path that
      a noble King once walked; their souls still illuminate our people. And always
      will.
  - message: ' ...?'
  - message: Would this noble king be my father? The tombs are not here? ... I see.
  - message: ' So... my journey has only resulted in more questions.'
  - message: However... it was not in vain. The legends did not come true, but it
      was enough. I believe it's still possible to converse with the heroes of old.
      Perhaps with that, we can solve our problems... I hope there is a solution.
      Very well...
  - message: My work is not yet done. I will make this castle our new stronghold.
  - message: First, I will cleanse this place, making it a safe haven for my people.
  - message: After that, I will embark on another journey... one to uncover the truth
      behind all of this.
  - message: ... Well, I better get started. There's no time to waste.
