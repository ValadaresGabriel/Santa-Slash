  - message: ... Very well, it seems I managed to escape. However, I don't quite
      understand what's going on here.
  - message: Suddenly, out of nowhere, a curse befell my people.
  - message: People started turning into monsters, and now, against my will, I have
      to defend myself against those who once were loyal to me.
  - message: At first, I should explore a bit... all I know is that my only clue
      is that I need to reach the castle of an ancient mage who once saved the world
      from a catastrophe.
  - message: I would really like her to save me from mine this time, but I guess
      it wouldn't be that easy...
