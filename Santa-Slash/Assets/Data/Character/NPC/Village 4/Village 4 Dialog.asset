  - message: My King... why did you destroy the walls... and now where can I hide??
  - message: It's okay... anyway, the monsters could jump down from there. It's not
      completely safe.
  - message: Well, at least now you're here.
  - message: But not for long...
  - message: What? Are you leaving? You can't do that.
  - message: You already abandoned us once; everything fell apart. Our families and
      friends were cursed, and now you think you can fix your mistake?
  - message: ' It wasn''t my fault. I don''t even know what happened.'
  - message: ' It doesn''t matter. You''re a ruler, and rulers bear the weight of
      their nation.'
  - message: That's exactly why I can't stay here.
  - message: It can't just end like this; I need to go.
  - message: ' Please, my king, don''t go, don''t leave me alone in this snow, with
      these monsters.'
  - message: ... Farewell. I will come back for you; I will seek more survivors.
  - message: (He was right... this is my responsibility, and something I must face
      the consequences of, so I can't give up. It's not about losing less this time.)
  - message: (It's about creating the best possible outcome for this tragedy.)
