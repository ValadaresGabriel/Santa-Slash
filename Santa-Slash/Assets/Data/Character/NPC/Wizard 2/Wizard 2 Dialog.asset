  - message: " \u2026."
  - message: ' Ah, a wizard, I finally found you.'
  - message: Oh great king, seeking trouble?
  - message: Not trouble, but solutions.
  - message: I too am searching for solutions.
  - message: ... About the curse?
  - message: No... I've been trying for 756 days to break that mysterious rock over
      there, but it doesn't seem like I can even hit it. How mysterious...
  - message: ' It''s not about that... what I want to know is the secrets behind
      this curse.'
  - message: My noble king, only the ancient heroes know about that.
  - message: Are they to blame?
  - message: ' No, but they have fought against what you are going through. It''s
      an enemy they once had in common...'
  - message: ... What should I do?
  - message: ' I can sell you some items, but I can''t give you answers.'
  - message: ' ... The other wizard, do you know the other wizard? Does he know something?'
  - message: Ah, yes, the other wizard. If you follow the course of the river, eventually,
      you will find him.
  - message: And the castle?
  - message: ' You will likely find your way to the castle.'
  - message: ' I see, thank you very much for your wisdom.'
  - message: Oh, and remember one thing, if you encounter the other wizard, tell
      him.
  - message: Making water in the desert is much more useful than freezing water in
      a cold place.
  - message: ' ... I don''t know why, but I have a feeling he''ll disagree with you.'
