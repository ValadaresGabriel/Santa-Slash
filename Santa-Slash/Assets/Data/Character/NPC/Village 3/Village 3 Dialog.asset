  - message: ' King! King! Over here.'
  - message: I'm already here...
  - message: It's so good to see you well, my king.
  - message: ' It amazes me too to see someone alive in these parts.'
  - message: What a tragedy, what a tragedy, my king... everyone is gone because
      of this curse. My parents, beloved... almost no one is left. I ran and hid
      as fast as I could, afraid of turning into one of them too.
  - message: ' I will seek others, even if I don''t unravel this curse for now. Still,
      it is necessary to fulfill my duty as a king.'
  - message: Long live the king!
  - message: Don't shout... keep quiet around here. After I get a better sense of
      things, I will gather everyone and bring them together in one place.
  - message: Of course, my good king, I'll be waiting. It's okay.
  - message: Are you going to the castle?
  - message: Yes, do you know any way?
  - message: ' Well... if you head to the EAST, I believe you''ll reach the Desert.
      There, you can go around the river and climb up to the castle.'
  - message: I heard there's a mage in those parts too; maybe he knows something???
  - message: ' Good to know... thank you.'
