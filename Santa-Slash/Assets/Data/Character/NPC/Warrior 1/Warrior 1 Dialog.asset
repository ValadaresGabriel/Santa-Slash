  initialDialogMessages:
  - message: Take a seat, my king. Rest, for your journey is still long.
  - message: I didn't expect to see a formidable warrior here...
  - message: Well... unfortunately, the curse didn't catch up to me. Now we are alone
      in this cursed world.
  - message: ' Don''t say that. The world needs strong individuals.'
  - message: When there are no strong people, weak people with strong determination
      arise...
  - message: ' ...'
  - message: But with a determination that is necessary for us to grow and move forward.
  - message: I am on a quest to unravel this mystery.
  - message: ' About the tragedy?'
  - message: Yes... something has to be done.
  - message: ' You haven''t lost hope yet, so repair your items with me. I''ll be
      happy to continue the hope.'
  - message: ' Haha, very well, soldier. Please help those who remain. I plan to
      gather everyone at my camp, and then we will march to the castle.'
  - message: ' To the castle? But is it safe there? There are monsters everywhere,
      and wasn''t it cursed or something?'
  - message: ' I will find out more from now on. Maybe it''s a good starting point...
      if it''s dangerous, I''ll make sure it''s not after my passage.'
  - message: Very well, seek the mages, my king. They should know how to guide you.
      I... I will do what you asked me to. Besides, it's a plea from the king himself.
      A warrior cannot refuse an opportunity like this.
