  - message: Well, what a surprise! My good king! I can't believe you found me here.
  - message: ' Thank God, a survivor.'
  - message: What are you doing here, my king? Now that everything is over... I...
      I don't know what to do. I've lost everything.
  - message: ... I haven't given up yet.
  - message: ' What?'
  - message: ' I haven''t given up yet. I have to go to the castle; maybe there are
      some answers there.'
  - message: But, my king, there are many monsters everywhere, and the worst part
      is... they're ours...
  - message: ... Even in the face of our tragedies, we have no right to give up.
  - message: This is for everyone who once trusted us.
  - message: ' ... Very well. The castle is within the boundaries of these areas,
      right? It''s impossible to get lost like this; when in doubt, walk in a straight
      line following the boundaries.'
  - message: ' I know that very well.'
  - message: Of course, my king, before you go!
  - message: I'm thinking about which part of the beach is the easiest to cross to
      the other side.
  - message: ' I wouldn''t recommend swimming... those waters are deep and full of
      secrets. It''s never good to enter the water unprepared. Get a boat! I will
      return soon to gather the rest of the population.'
  - message: Alright, until we meet again, my king.
