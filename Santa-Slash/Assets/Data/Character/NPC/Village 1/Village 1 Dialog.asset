  initialDialogMessages:
  - message: My good king! I can't believe you survived.
  - message: A survivor?
  - message: ' Yes, for some reason the curse didn''t affect me.'
  - message: ... I see. You can return along my path; it's safer to walk where I've
      cleared the monsters than to wander aimlessly for now.
  - message: Once I complete my mission, I'll return, and we'll seek a new home for
      our people.
  - message: Thank you very much, my king. Take this with you; it may help you on
      your journey.
  - message: Lastly, I believe a mage who passed by me headed to the cold lands,
      which lie to the NORTH.
  - message: Thank you. Take care, and I will return soon.
  - message: (Not all of my people turned into monsters, it seems... Some have survived.)
  - message: (I must keep searching; I hope to find more people.)
  - message: (Apparently, my purpose has not completely faded away.)

  - message: I will be waiting for your return!
